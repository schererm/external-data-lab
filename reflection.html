                I preferred to use Claude Sonnet 4.5 for more specific aspects of the assignment, and the 
                internal Copilot GPT for the bones of the project. I told the internal copilot "write me a 
                basic html 5 layout for a homepage" and it was very helpful. It gave me a valid layout that was 
                easy to understand. For more specific instructions, I gave Claude more detailed prompts. For 
                Example, "With this API: https://openlibrary.org/search.json write me javascript that fetches two 
                genres of books". It returned specific fetch programming that was stylized quite well. I had to go 
                in and change some of the specifics, but overall using the two AIs showed their specific strengths.
                I feel like Claude was better for the more specific tasks because I was able to give it more 
                information about the assignment than I did the internal Copilot.
